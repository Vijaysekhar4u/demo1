this is for learning of creating  a branch and merging a brach in local

initailly create a brach by using " git branch feature"

then it created a branch file named as feature.

the data in main brach copied in this feature branch

you can see that data by using the ls command

for changing a branch in git bash you can give the command of git branch checkout feature.

git branch gives the status of which branch you are in the location

git commit -m "abcd" gives you the commit in local file
